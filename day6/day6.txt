 Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to initialize the Git repository.

Initialize Git Repository: Use the following command to initialize a new Git repository:


git init

Create a Text File: Create a simple text file in the directory. You can use any text editor you prefer.  let's create a file named sample.txt:



Add the Text File to Git: Use the following command to add the text file to the staging area:



git add sample.txt

Commit the Changes: Now, commit the changes to the repository 


git commit -m "Initial commit"











assignment2:



# Create a new branch named 'feature'

git branch feature

# Switch to the 'feature' branch

git checkout feature
Once you're in the 'feature' branch, you can make your changes to the code or files. After making your changes, you'll want to stage and commit them

bash:

# Add the changes to the staging area

git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message

git commit -m "Implemented feature XYZ"
Now, your changes are committed to the 'feature' branch. You can continue making more changes, committing them as needed, until you're ready to merge the 'feature' branch back into the main branch or any other target branch.
