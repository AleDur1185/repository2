Assignment 3: Research and compare SDLC models suitable for engineering projects. Present findings on Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model approaches, emphasizing their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability in different engineering contexts.




Waterfall Model:

Characteristics: The Waterfall model is a linear sequential approach, where progress flows in a downward direction (like a waterfall) through phases such as Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Advantages:
Clear and well-defined stages.
Easy to understand and manage.
Suitable for projects with stable requirements.

Disadvantages:  ->at requirement stage, the client has to give all the requirment.it is fixed
   and finalize. later client can't change the requirement.
 -> changes cannot be accepted.
     -> client the see the product only at the end.
     -> specify all the requirement at requirement gathering stage only.
        Limited flexibility for changes once a phase is completed.
        Late detection of errors or issues.
        Customer feedback is often delayed until later stages.
        Applicability: Suitable for projects with well-understood and unchanging requirements, such as building physical infrastructure     or hardware systems.sutable for small projects


Agile Model:

Characteristics:  -> It is iterative incremental software development model.
   -> In agile,we develope the products in sprints, 
   -> At the end of each sprint, we develop a particular software 
      feature. eg: login feature,
     Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, focusing on adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. 
     It emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid iterations.
Advantages:
 -> after every sprint, customer can see the product and give the feedback.
       for improvement.
    - adding new features easily.   
    - flexible for requirement change.
     improves quality.
     customer satisfication. 
    Risk management. -> (if any risk in there, it will be notified at early 
                            stage only.
     Continuous customer involvement and feedback.
     Early delivery of working software.

Disadvantages:
Requires active customer involvement, which may not always be feasible.
Lack of emphasis on documentation may lead to knowledge gaps.
May not be suitable for projects with fixed deadlines or strict regulatory requirements.

Applicability: Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as software development, 
where quick adaptation to changing market needs is crucial.

Spiral Model:

Characteristics: > In spiral model, the software are developed based on iterations/module.
   -> It is widely used model, for large scale applicatio we can use spiral model.

   when to choose spiral model:-
   ----------------------------
      ->when the risk, is more invoved in the project. then we can 
      choose spiral model.

      -> when the requirement are not clearly understand

The Spiral model combines the iterative nature of prototyping with the systematic aspects of the Waterfall model. 
It involves cyclic iterations of development phases, each passing through the same sequence of steps but with increasing detail and refinement.

Advantages:
Allows for early identification and mitigation of risks.
Flexibility to incorporate changes during development.
Suitable for large and complex projects with uncertain or evolving requirements.

Disadvantages:
Complex and may require more resources and time.
Risk management activities may become extensive.
Progress can be difficult to measure.

Applicability: Well-suited for projects where requirements are not fully understood or are likely to change over time, 
such as developing new technologies or innovative products.


V-Model:

Characteristics: The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall model, emphasizing the verification and validation of each stage of development. 
It involves corresponding testing activities for each development stage, forming a V-shaped lifecycle.


Advantages:
Strong emphasis on testing and validation.
Clear mapping of requirements to test cases.
Early detection of defects and issues.


Disadvantages:
Can be rigid and less adaptable to changes.
Testing activities may become time-consuming and expensive.
Customer feedback may be limited until later stages.

Applicability: Suitable for projects where strict adherence to requirements and quality standards is paramount, 
such as safety-critical systems or projects subject to regulatory compliance.
