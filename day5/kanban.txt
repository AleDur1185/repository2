Creating a Kanban board for an online doctor application involves organizing tasks into columns representing different stages of development or completion. Here's a suggested structure:

Backlog: This column contains all the tasks that need to be done for the application but haven't been started yet. This could include features like user registration, appointment scheduling, payment integration, etc.

To-Do: Once a task is ready to be worked on, it moves to this column. Tasks here are prioritized and ready for the team to pick up.

In Progress: Tasks that team members are currently working on are placed in this column. This provides visibility into what's actively being worked on and helps prevent duplication of effort.

Review: Once a task is completed, it moves to this column for review. This could involve code review, testing, or other quality assurance processes to ensure that the task meets the required standards.

Testing: Tasks that have been reviewed and are ready for testing are placed in this column. This could include both manual and automated testing to identify any bugs or issues.

Done: Tasks that have been completed and tested successfully are moved to this column. They are considered done and ready for deployment.
